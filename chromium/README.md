Chromium Browser
---
As of 20190822, this has been integrated to [**RuneAudio+R e1**](https://github.com/rern/RuneAudio-Re1).

**Chromium** has the least issues as an alternative browser
- Chromium cannot be installed without `ffmpeg` upgrade
- `ffmpeg` upgrade breaks `mpd-rune`
- upgrade `ffmpeg` + `mpd` > install `chromium`
- fix ipv6 probing
- fix scaling
