Chromium Browser
---
(Install Chromium breaks default MPD. MPD Upgrade needed.)  

**Chromium** has the least issues as an alternative browser
- Chromium cannot be installed without `ffmpeg` upgrade
- `ffmpeg` upgrade breaks `mpd-rune`
- upgrade `ffmpeg` + `mpd` > install `chromium`
- fix ipv6 probing
- fix scaling
